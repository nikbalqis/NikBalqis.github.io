									<p><b>Industrial Talk 2:</b> Wrote a report consisting of a description of the system development, history, technology and tools used in <strong><i>Credence's system development</i></strong>.</p>
								</header><hr />
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="media/A3-IT2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									The speaker shared her personal journey and experience studying data engineering at UTM, providing valuable insights into the field and the necessary skills. I gained exposure to the detailed analytics process, 
									from data collection and transformation to model building and visualization. This overview helped me understand various roles, such as data engineering and data analysis. The presentation highlighted some technologies 
									like databases, visualization tools, ETL tools, and programming languages. Personally, I think Credence's workplace culture, emphasizing communication, learning, empowerment, and celebrating success, was particularly motivating. 
									Moreover, providing more details about specific projects and challenges faced could be interesting. Overall, it was insightful, and similar industry talks exposing students to the real working world would be beneficial.</p>

								<p>My aim is to become an excellent system developer by continuously learning new technologies, polishing my skills, and gaining experience through projects and internships. I'll
									stay eager to explore new tools and programming languages in this rapidly evolving sector. I'll actively seek opportunities to work on a variety of analytics projects and learn 
									from mentors. With dedication and resilience, I'm excited to develop into a competent system developer who can design end-to-end data solutions and deliver meaningful insights through analytics.</p>

									<h2 id="topic6">Assignment 4: Newsletter</h2>
									<p><b>Industrial Talk 3:</b> Prepared a newsletter on <strong><i>Tech-Driven Innovation</i></strong> by summarizing the talk and listing the technologies and issues discussed during the talk.</p>
								</header><hr />
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="media/A4-IT3.png" alt="" /></span>
									The talk provided the overview of i-Farm's business strategy and goals, introducing the innovative idea of bringing fresh vegetables directly to residents through neighborhood-based vertical farming racks. 
									The well-thought-out business model and revenue streams, along with promising profitability projections, were highlighted. The use of IoT and machine learning for plant growth optimization showcased innovation. 
									i-Farm's market research  indicates a positive trajectory, targeting health-conscious residents and successful pilots with government agencies. I'm very impressed by their ambitious vision to expand across 
									Malaysia and Southeast Asia, and improve regional food security. They also collaborate with local farmers to share technology which offers mutual benefits. A suggestion for improvement is to conduct more testing 
									of crop varieties and business model variations before scaling across regions. Overall, i-Farm presents an innovative urban farming model that could enhance food resilience and sustainability if successfully executed. 
									I gained perspective on how vertical farming and technology can transform agriculture.</p>

								<hr />
								<p>The i-Farm model provides an innovative solution for providing fresh organic produce to communities by utilizing vertical hydroponic farming systems deployed locally. I found it inspiring to learn how they 
									took the challenges of the pandemic as motivation to find a new way to leverage technology to improve food security. The i-Farm model allows consumers to have a deeper connection with the source of their food. 
									I learned how hydroponics and machine learning can be used to improve fresh food access in innovative ways. I gained valuable perspective on the importance of local food systems.</p>
